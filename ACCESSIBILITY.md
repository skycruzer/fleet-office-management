# B767 Fleet Management - Accessibility Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility implementation for the B767 Fleet Management application, ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance while addressing aviation industry-specific accessibility requirements for safety-critical information.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation and Structure

#### Skip Links ✅
- **Location**: `/src/components/ui/skip-links.tsx`

- **Text Alternatives**: All status indicators include descriptive text
- **Screen Reader Support**: Detailed announcements for certification statuses
- **Priority Levels**: High-priority alerts use assertive ARIA live regions

#### Status Classifications with Screen Reader Support:
```typescript
EXPIRED: "CRITICAL ALERT: Certification expired X days ago. Pilot cannot fly until renewed. Immediate action required."
CRITICAL: "URGENT: Certification expires in X days. Schedule renewal immediately to prevent flight restrictions."
URGENT: "Important: Certification expires in X days. Action required within the next week."
WARNING: "Notice: Certification expires in X days. Begin renewal process."
ATTENTION: "Advisory: Certification expires in X days. Plan for renewal."
CURRENT: "Current: Certification expires in X days. No immediate action needed."
```

### 3. Color Contrast and Visual Design

#### WCAG AA Compliance ✅
All color combinations tested and meet minimum contrast ratios:

| Status | Text Contrast | Background | WCAG Level |
|--------|---------------|------------|------------|

## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing
1. **Tab through entire application**
   - [ ] All interactive elements are reachable
   - [ ] Focus indicators are visible and high contrast
   - [ ] Tab order is logical and intuitive
   - [ ] No keyboard traps exist

2. **Test skip links**
   - [ ] Skip links appear on first tab
   - [ ] Skip links navigate to correct sections
   - [ ] Focus moves appropriately after skip link activation

3. **Test interactive elements**
   - [ ] Buttons activate with Enter and Space
   - [ ] Links activate with Enter
   - [ ] Form controls work with keyboard only
   - [ ] Modal dialogs trap focus and close with Escape

#### Screen Reader Testing
Using NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver:

1. **Content Structure**
